# Problem 2 Solution

- install dependencies with `npm install`
- run with `npm run start`

The server will listen over port 7777.

# Assumptions

1. This implemenation assumes that the balloons are not filled with the different types of gas (such as a gas heavier than air), so we can expect two balloons of the same volume will share the same mass.
2. It does not assume that the request constraints will be explicitly followed by the clients making requests, so it does check to ensure all of the request data is compliant.
